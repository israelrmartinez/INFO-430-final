# INFO-430-final
 
While each student must generate their own set of coded objects, this is a team deliverable. It is assumed that each team is reviewing each other's material and coordinating a 'project build' that reflects tested/proven code. As such, each team member is responsible for ensuring that the entire set of deliverable code at least parses. Code that does not parse is subject to 0 points being awarded.

 

Each team member must code 2 of each of the following (8 objects per student):

1) Stored procedure

2) Check constraint

3) Computed column

4) Views

As stated in lecture, grading will be based on the student's ability to leverage complex skills presented in lecture and should include the following where appropriate:

* explicit transactions

* Complexity as appropriate: multiple JOINs, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, TOP, RANK, CROSS APPLY

* error-handling

* passing of appropriate  parameters (name values and/or output parameters)

* subqueries

* variables
